# DoomedDice

Part-A (15-20 Minutes):
1. How many total combinations are possible? Show the math along with the code!

3. Calculate and display the distribution of all possible combinations that can be
obtained when rolling both Die A and Die B together. Show the math along with
the code!
Hint: A 6 x 6 Matrix.

4. Calculate the Probability of all Possible Sums occurring among the number of
combinations from (2).
Example: P(Sum = 2) = 1/X as there is only one combination possible to obtain
Sum = 2. Die A = Die B = 1.

Part B:
Input:
● Die_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] & Die B = Die_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output:
● A Transform Function undoom_dice that takes (Die_A, Die_B) as input &
outputs New_Die_A = [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?],New_Die_B = [?, ?,
?, ?, ?, ?] where,
● No New_Die A[x] > 4
